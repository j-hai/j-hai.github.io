Many of his works appear in top journals, including Science, Nature, and PNAS, as well as leading field journals in political science, statistics, economics, and business.

He has developed widely adopted statistical methods—such as [synthetic control methods](https://j-hai.github.io/projects/2_project_scm/), [entropy balancing](https://j-hai.github.io/projects/4_project_ebal/), [average marginal component effects](https://j-hai.github.io/projects/5_project_Conjoint_Experiments/), and [GeoMatch algorithms](https://immigrationlab.org/geomatch/)—and created several open-source software packages that support empirical research across disciplines. At Stanford, he teaches [course](https://j-hai.github.io/teaching/) on causal inference and data science.

Hainmueller’s contributions have been recognized with various awards, including the Gosnell Prize for Excellence in Political Methodology, the Warren Miller Prize, the Robert H.

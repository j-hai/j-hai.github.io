In {% cite marten2019ethnic %}, we investigate the role of ethnic networks in promoting the economic integration of refugees. Using detailed administrative data and a quasi-experimental design where refugees are exogenously assigned to resettlement locations, this study examines how the presence of co-ethnic communities influences refugees' labor market outcomes and economic self-sufficiency.

We find that refugees resettled in areas with strong co-ethnic networks are significantly more likely to secure employment. Further mechanism tests suggest that spatially concentrated ethnic networks facilitate the sharing of information about job opportunities, catalyzing the economic integration of refugees.

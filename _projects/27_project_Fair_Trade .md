### Consumer Demand for Fair Trade: Evidence from a Multistore Field Experiment

In {% cite hainmueller2015consumer %}, this study provides new insights into consumer demand for ethically sourced products using field experiments conducted in a U.S. grocery store chain. The results show that sales of the two most popular coffee brands increased by nearly 10% when labeled as Fair Trade, compared to a generic placebo label.  

The study also highlights price sensitivity among consumers. While demand for higher-priced coffee remained stable despite an 8% price increase, demand for lower-priced coffee proved more elastic, with a 9% price hike leading to a 30% decline in sales. These findings indicate that while consumers value ethical sourcing, there is considerable variation in their willingness to pay for it.

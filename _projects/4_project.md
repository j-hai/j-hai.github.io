Entropy Balancing is a statistical method implemented as both an R package and a Stata routine, designed for reweighting data to achieve covariate balance in observational studies.

The method is based on the approaches developed in {% cite hainmueller2012entropy %} and {% cite hainmueller2013ebalance %} , and it won the Warren Miller Award from the Society of Political Methodology in 2020.

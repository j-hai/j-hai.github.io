We have conducted various studies using healthcare records to examine health disparities and the social determinants of health. In particular, we have done research that examines the impacts of immigration and healthcare policies on health outcomes.

### The Health Impact of DACA on U.S. Citizen Children

In {% cite hainmueller2017protecting %}, we provided causal evidence on the impact of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on the health of U.S. citizen children in mixed-status families. Utilizing Medicaid claims data from Oregon and the quasi-random assignment of DACA eligibility based on mothers' birthdates near the program's age cutoff, we demonstrated that mothers' DACA eligibility significantly decreased diagnoses of adjustment and anxiety disorders in their children. This research underscores the broad societal impacts of immigration policies beyond the direct recipients.

### Expanding Prenatal Care

In {% cite swartz2017expanding %} and {% cite swartz2019oregon %}, we analyzed the impacts of Oregon?s expansion of prenatal care access for undocumented women. This program was rolled out gradually across counties, allowing for a quasi-experimental analysis of its effects. Key findings include that access to prenatal care led to significant enhancements in health outcomes for both women and their children.

### Immigration Enforcement and Health Care Utilization

In {% cite yasenov2020healthcare %}, we examined the association between healthcare utilization and immigration enforcement events in San Francisco. This study demonstrated that in the context of the inclusive, local health care system in San Francisco, heightened immigration enforcement was not linked to reduced healthcare visits. 

### Public Health Insurance for Immigrant Children

In {% cite yasenov2020public %}, we explored the effects of public health insurance expansion for immigrant children on interstate migration of low-income immigrant families. Our findings showed that the expansion significantly did not prompt significant migration across state lines.

### Neighborhood Disadvantage and Refugee Health

In {% cite kim2023neighborhood %}, we conducted a quasi-experimental study examining the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and the risk of dementia and mortality among refugees in Denmark. Our findings highlighted that refugees resettled in disadvantaged neighborhoods faced higher risks of dementia and mortality, underscoring the long-term health impacts of resettlement policies and neighborhood environments.

### Can Mandatory Integration Contracts Foster Immigrant Integration?

In {% cite emeriau2022welcome %}, we examine whether integration contracts, introduced by European governments to aid immigrant incorporation, achieve their intended goals. These contracts combine language training and compulsory civics courses to encourage cultural assimilation, respect for societal values, and improved labor market outcomes. Despite their widespread adoption, evidence on their effectiveness has been scarce.

To evaluate their impact, we exploit the staggered rollout of Franceâ€™s integration contract across metropolitan departments from 2003 to 2006, using a regression discontinuity design. By analyzing census data, labor force surveys, and a novel survey of refugees, we find that integration contracts facilitated short-term employment gains without provoking backlash. However, these benefits did not extend to long-term integration improvements, suggesting limited lasting effects.

This study highlights the potential and limitations of integration contracts in addressing the challenges of immigrant integration.

### Identifying Opportunities to Improve the Network of Immigration Legal Services Providers

In {% cite yasenov2020identifyingopportunitiesimprovenetwork %}, this study investigates the geographic distribution and accessibility of immigration legal services providers (ISPs) in the United States, which are a critical resource for low-income immigrants seeking legal support. Despite their importance, little quantitative evidence exists about the prevalence and spatial organization of ISPs nationwide.  

To address this gap, the authors construct a comprehensive database of 2,138 geocoded ISP offices offering low- or no-cost services. Using spatial optimization methods, they analyze the proximity of ISPs to low-income immigrant populations. The findings reveal that while ISPs and immigrants are largely concentrated in major urban centers, a substantial fraction of low-income immigrants live in underserved areas, particularly in midsize cities in the South. This pattern reflects broader trends in non-governmental service provision and the more recent migration of immigrants to these regions.  

The study also demonstrates that strategic placement of new ISPs in underserved areas could significantly increase the number of low-income immigrants with access to legal services. These findings provide valuable insights for immigrants, funders, and policymakers, highlighting opportunities to enhance the ISP network and better serve vulnerable populations.

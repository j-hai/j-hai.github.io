### Heading

In {% cite lutz2006electoral %}, This paper takes a fresh look at the midterm loss in German elections and argues that
government type is a crucial determinant of midterm loss. Using panel regressions on a
newly compiled data set covering all state elections during the period 1949â€“2004, we
find that systematic midterm losses occur only when both chambers of the federal
legislature (Bundestag and Bundesrat) are controlled by one party or a party coalition.
Prior research has failed to discover this important regularity. These findings lend
strong support to electoral balancing models while calling into doubt more traditional
explanations of midterm loss.

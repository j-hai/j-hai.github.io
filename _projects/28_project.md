### How Lasting Is Voter Gratitude?

In {% cite c2013capitol %}, this study explores the persistence of voter gratitude for government policies, addressing key questions in theories of electoral behavior and democratic accountability. While voters are often thought to evaluate policy performance myopically, little is known about how long governments receive electoral credit for beneficial policies.  

The analysis leverages the massive policy response to the 2002 Elbe flooding in Germany to estimate the short- and long-term electoral returns of targeted benefits. The findings show that the flood response increased the incumbent party's vote share in affected areas by 7 percentage points in the 2002 election. Notably, 25% of this short-term reward carried over to the 2005 election, though the gains disappeared by 2009.  

These results suggest that, under favorable circumstances, voter gratitude can persist longer than previously recognized. The study highlights important implications for electoral behavior, democratic accountability, and the strategic design of public policy.

## Measuring Integration

We developed the **IPL-12 Integration Index**, a practical and multidimensional tool for measuring immigrant integration. The absence of a standardized measure has hindered integration research, making it challenging to compare findings across studies, countries, and time. The IPL-12 addresses this gap by providing a reliable, versatile framework to evaluate six key dimensions of integration:

- **Psychological**
- **Economic**
- **Political**
- **Social**
- **Linguistic**
- **Navigational**

### Why Use the IPL-12?

The IPL-12 is a flexible, user-friendly tool that has become a resource for researchers, policymakers, and organizations to measure migrants' integration outcomes. Benefits include:

- **Global Applicability:** Designed to be used across countries, immigrant groups, and time periods.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Administered through concise questionnaires available in multiple formats.
- **Reliability and Validity:** Balances short survey length with reliability.

### Validation and Widespread Adoption

The IPL-12 has been validated through surveys conducted in diverse countries and among varied immigrant populations. Its utility is reflected in its adoption by prominent organizations such as:

- **[International Organization for Migration (IOM)](https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl2616/files/documents/Structure%20and%20Application%20of%20the%20IOM-IPL%20Index.pdf):** Leveraged to assess integration outcomes across global contexts.
- **[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/106568):** Used to evaluate refugee integration, enabling evidence-based policies and programs.

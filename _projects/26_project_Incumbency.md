### Incumbency as a Source of Spillover Effects in Mixed Electoral Systems

In {% cite hainmueller2008incumbency %}, this study demonstrates that incumbency generates spillover effects in Germany's mixed electoral system. Using a quasi-experimental research design that allows for causal inferences with fewer assumptions than traditional regression models, the study finds that incumbency increases proportional representation (PR) vote shares by 1.4â€“1.7 percentage points. Simulations of Bundestag seat distributions reveal that these spillover effects are significant enough to shift parliamentary majorities, highlighting the broader political implications of incumbency advantages.

### Assessing the External Validity of Election RD Estimates: An Investigation of the Incumbency Advantage

In {% cite hainmueller2015assessing %}, the regression discontinuity (RD) design is used to estimate the incumbency advantage in tightly contested elections. While RD provides robust local estimates for 50-50 races, its applicability to less competitive districts has been uncertain. This study introduces a novel method to extend RD estimates to elections where the winner secured up to 57.5% of the two-party vote. The findings confirm that the incumbency advantage remains consistent across both competitive and less competitive races, enhancing the external validity of RD estimates.

In {% cite mossaad2020migration %}, we leverage nationwide population-level microdata to explore how and why refugees in the U.S. relocate after initial resettlement. Our analysis focuses on the roles of economic opportunities, community networks, and local support systems. We find no significant evidence that refugeesâ€™ locational choices are strongly influenced by state partisanship or the generosity of welfare benefits. Instead, refugees prioritize destinations with better employment prospects and established co-national networks.
